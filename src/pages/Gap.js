            <p>
              The Wicklow mountains are a popular filming location for movies
              such as 'Braveheart' and 'PS I Love You' as well as the TV show
              'Vikings' which did extensive filming in this area. From here it
              is possible on a clear day to see the Snowdonia mountains in Wales
              across the Irish sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are very few trees in this area, this is not uncommon in the
              Irish countryside. In 1900 only 1% of Ireland was covered in
              forest at a time when 33 percent was the European average. The
              British empire made many of their boats as well as manor houses
              from Irish oak. In the 70â€™s a process of reforestation began with
              aim to reach 18% by 2045, currently the figure is 12%.
