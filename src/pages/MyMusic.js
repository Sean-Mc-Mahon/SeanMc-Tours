        Irish music has something for everyone and one of my favourite things
        about doing tours in Ireland is introducing people to my favourite Irish
        music. I always start the morning off with my favourite Irish singer
        songwriters The past few decades have produced some really amazing
        singer songwriters, Cathy Davey, Lisa Hannigan and Mick Flannery to name
        a few. It's mainly acoustic and soft at this hour as it is quite early
        and many people want to sleep.

        Once everyone is a little more awake I'll play some of the more
        internationally known Irish acts such as U2, Sinead O'Connor, The
        Cranberries and Thin Lizzy. A lot of this music comes from the 80's and
        90's, a boom period for Irish musicians internationally.

        Generally on my tours I'll play modern Irish music while we're on the
        motorways and once we reach the country roads I'll play a playlist I
        call Trad(ish), a mix of traditional and folk music. This playlist
        contains some of my favourite folk acts such as The Dubliners and The
        Pogues and some acts which veer more towards rock acts with a celtic
        feel such as The Saw Doctors.
      </p>

        If there are any songs you want to hear while on a tour just let me know
        and I'll gladly play any requests you want to hear.
