        Irish food is best described as rustic, farmhouse style cooking. Ireland
        does not have the same culinary reputation as other European countries
        such as France or Italy but we produce meat, produce and dairy products
        of exceptional quality. Mass farming is not prevalent in Ireland, our
        animals are generally free to graze on the lush green grass which grows
        year round.

        One of the things I miss most about Irish food while abroad is Irish
        breakfast. It usually consists of sausage, bacon, egg and balck and
        white pudding, served with toast and tea or coffee.

        Pudding is a form of sausage made from pork, breadcrumbs, oats and
        spices. Black pudding varies from white pudding with the addition of
        blood.

        Salting and smoking have traditionally been the main methods of
        preserving food in Ireland. Smoked salmon is another example of Irish
        cuisine. While I am not a fan of it myself, as an island nation Ireland
        is known for it's seafood. Oysters and Guinness are said to make for a
        particulary good combination while fish and chips are always popular
        too.

        I'm often asked where to get Irish Stew and Shepard's Pie, it's tricky
        to answer as they are mostly associated with home cooking. While you
        will find these dishes around Dublin they are mainly served in the pubs
        around temple bar which usually cater towards tourists and can be over
        priced.
